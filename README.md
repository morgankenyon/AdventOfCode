# Advent of Code 2023

My Advent of Code 2023 Solutions. 

To run (from root directory):

* `cd ../AdventOfCode``
* `dotnet build`
* `dotnet run <day>` or `dotnet run <day><problem>`
  * Examples:
    * `dotnet run 1`
    * `dotnet run 1a`
    * `dotnet run 1b`

Once a got a problem working I generally do not go back and clean up. So there is some messy code.
